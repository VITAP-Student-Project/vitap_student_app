/// already Quick Access destinations. Navigation belongs to one system, so the
/// shortcuts are gone and the room they freed now carries the weather, which
/// previously cost a whole section of the home page.

/// [FlexibleSpaceBar]: the flexible bar's only extra trick is scaling its title
/// as you scroll, and a transform-scaled temperature and Lottie resample badly
/// where a bare avatar did not. Height is set directly instead, which gives the
