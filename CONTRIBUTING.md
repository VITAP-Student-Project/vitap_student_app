## Development Setup
To set up the project for local development:

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    - Flutter SDK 3.10+ ([Installation Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install))
    - Dart SDK (included with Flutter)
    - Rust toolchain ([Installation Guide](https://rustup.rs/))
    - Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions
    - Android device/emulator (Android 6.0+) or iOS device/simulator

2.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already forked and cloned):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-name/vit_ap_student_app.git
    cd vit_ap_student_app
    ```

3.  **Verify Flutter installation**:
    ```bash
    flutter doctor
    ```
    Resolve any issues shown by the doctor command.

4.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

5.  **Rust setup** (if working on backend features):
    ```bash
    # Install Rust if not already installed
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    source ~/.cargo/env
    
    # Verify Rust installation
    rustc --version
    cargo --version
    ```

6.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    # First navigate to the rust folder to create a rust build
    cd rust
    cargo build --release

    # Make sure rust bindings are generated(if not do the step 7)
    # For debug mode
    flutter run
    
    # For specific platform
    flutter run -d android
    flutter run -d ios
    ```

7.  **Code generation** (if applicable):
    ```bash
    # For generating model classes, routes, etc.
    dart run build_runner watch
    
    # For Rust bridge code generation
    flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate
    ```

## Coding Guidelines

### Flutter/Dart Style Guide
- Follow the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) style guide.
- Use `flutter analyze` to check for linting issues.
- Follow the existing project structure and naming conventions.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep widgets small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use proper state management patterns (currently using Riverpod).
- Add documentation comments for public APIs.
- Use type annotations where helpful for clarity.

### Rust Style Guide
- Follow the [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/style-guide/) and [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/).
- Use `cargo fmt` to format Rust code automatically.
- Use `cargo clippy` to check for common mistakes and improvements.
- Write comprehensive documentation for public functions and modules.
- Use meaningful variable and function names following Rust conventions (snake_case).
- Handle errors properly using `Result<T, E>` types.
- Use appropriate Rust idioms and patterns.
- Keep functions focused and avoid overly complex logic.
- Add unit tests for Rust functions using the built-in `#[cfg(test)]` attribute.

#### Rust Development Workflow
```bash
# Format Rust code
cargo fmt

# Check for linting issues
cargo clippy

# Run Rust tests
cargo test

# Build Rust code (done automatically by Flutter)
cargo build

# Generate Flutter-Rust bridge code
flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate
```

flutter test test/unit/models/student_test.dart

# Run Rust tests
cd rust && cargo test

# Run specific Rust test
cd rust && cargo test test_function_name
```

## Additional Notes
- This is a student-led project aimed at helping fellow VIT-AP students.
- Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.
- Consider the impact on app performance and user experience.
- Be mindful of security implications, especially for authentication features.
- Test your changes on both Android and iOS if possible.
- When working with Rust code, ensure proper error handling and memory safety.
- Flutter-Rust bridge changes may require regenerating bindings.
- Rust compilation may take longer on first build due to dependency compilation.

Thank you for contributing to making student life at VIT-AP better!
